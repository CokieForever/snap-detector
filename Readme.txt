Description: Snap Detector is a little application which is able to analyse ambient sound (you will need a microphone, of course...) in order to determine if there is a finger snap sound. In this case, the application is able to make a specific action like to switch the windows or to display the desktop, or to execute/open a file.
You can configure some additional parameters like the sampling frequency, the detection threshold or the length of the sample used for the detection. Once the application is launched, you can reduce it into the taskbar by closing the main windows. Just right-click/double-click on the taskbar icon to make it appear again.

Installation instructions:
Just launch the file "snapd.exe"! No installation, no hidden files into your system! If you want, you can place the whole folder into your Program Files folder (generally C:\Program Files) and create a shorcut in your desktop (right-click on the exe file and select "Create shortcut").

Please feel free to send any comment, suggestion, remark, etc.

Enjoy!
